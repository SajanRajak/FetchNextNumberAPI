FetchNextNumberAPI is the assignment done as instructed in the question.

Download this folder and open as maven project in any ide that supports SpringBoot.
I have used Spring Tool Suite for building this project.

Requirements:
	1. MySql 8.0
	2. Java jdk 8
	3. Spring Tool Suite 4 (Or any alternative)
	4. PostMan (or Alternative)

Run this project as spring boot application

Server port is set to 8080, if your 8080 port is busy, try changing the port number
in application.properties file in "FetchNextNumberAPI\src\main\resources\application.properties"
Or, you can kill the process id which is using the particular port using command prompt.

Junit testing can be found at:
"FetchNextNumberAPI\src\test\java\com\assignment\fetchNumber\FetchNextNumberAPI\FetchNextNumberApiApplicationTests.java"
Right click this file and Run as JUnit test to rull all the Test funtions

After running the project as Spring Boot Application. Open PostMan or any other alternative,
which can send requests to the running server in localhost:8080, or other port number if changed.

PostMan gives friendly UI, and following commands can be implmented for this RESTAPI:
	1. GET : localhost:8080/categories  		: to get all the categories present in the database
	2. GET : localhost:8080/category/{categoryId}   : to get details of a particular category id
	3. GET : localhost:8080/FetchNextNumber         : mentioned main link to implement, takes a random category id from table 
							  and udpdates it to next available id whose didgit sum = 1 and 
							  returns OldValue and NewValue as pair
	4. GET : localhost:8080/FetchNextNumber/{categoryId} : Does the same work as FetchNextNumber, but for the particular category Id that you pass
	5. POST : localhost:8080/category               : adds a new category object, which can be passed in JSON format
	6. DELETE : localhost:8080/categories           : deletes all the categories in the category table
	7. DELETE : localhost:8080/category/{categoryId}: deletes a category of provied particular id

All the values are returned as JSON, except DELETE methods send success messages as String.
